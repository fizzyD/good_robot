""" 
The well behaved robot
======================================
Scott Dyer
Neural Net Project for Aritificial Intelligence

This code was tested with python 2.6 and requires the neurolab
package as well as numpy.

This projects was based on the course from http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Learning_and_neural_networks
The goal of this project was to use the same data set but implement it in python using a neural net
package and use the numpy plotting to enable visualization of the network classification. neurolab 
was selected as it had a concise set of examples that also showed training error as a function of 
training iterations. The examples were simple, easy to understand and demonstrated a number of neural
network configurations and training techniques.

From the wikiversity page:
Your great uncle Otto recently passed away leaving you his mansion in Transylvania. 
When you go to move in, the locals warn you about the Werewolves and Vampires that lurk in the area. 
They also mention that both vampires and werewolves like to play pool, which is alarming to you since 
your new mansion has a billiard room. Being a savvy computer scientist you come up with a creative solution. 
You will buy a robot from Acme Robotics (of Walla Walla Washington). Youâ€™re going to use the robot to guard 
your billiard room and make sure nothing super natural finds its way there.
